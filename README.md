I have developed a deep learning model for fruit classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The project aimed to accurately classify different types of fruits from input images. Leveraging the power of CNNs, which are highly effective in image recognition tasks, the model was trained on a large dataset consisting of images of various fruits such as apples, oranges, bananas, strawberries, and more.
